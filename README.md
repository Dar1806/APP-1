# APP-1

This project is a Python desktop application that allows users to load, view, modify, and analyze sales data through a graphical interface.

The interface is built using the customtkinter library, and data is handled with pandas.

Users can load a CSV or Excel file containing sales information, search for specific entries by product name or order date, and display the best-selling product.

The application also provides options to edit existing sales records or add new ones, and all changes can be saved to a new CSV file.
